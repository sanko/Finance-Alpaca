# NAME

Finance::Alpaca - It's new $module

# SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Alpaca;

# DESCRIPTION

Finance::Alpaca is ... still under construction.

# METHODS

## `new( ... )`

    my $camelid = Finance::Alpaca->new(
        keys => [ 'MDJOHHAE5BDE2FAYAEQT',
                  'Xq9p6ovxaa5XKihaEDRgpMapjeWYd5gIM63iq5BL'
                ] );

Creates a new Finance::Alpaca object.

This constructor accepts the following parameters:

- `keys` - `[ $APCA_API_KEY_ID, $APCA_API_SECRET_KEY ]`

    Every API call requires authentication. You must provide these keys which may
    be acquired in the developer web console and are only visible on creation.

- `paper` - Boolean value

    If you're attempting to use Alpaca's paper trading functionality, this **must**
    be a true value. Otherwise, you will be making live trades with actual assets.

    **Note**: This is a false value by default.

## `account( )`

Returns a Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Account object.

The account endpoint serves important information related to an account,
including account status, funds available for trade, funds available for
withdrawal, and various flags relevant to an accountâ€™s ability to trade.

## `clock( )`

    my $clock = $camelid->clock();
    say sprintf
        $clock->timestamp->strftime('It is %l:%M:%S %p on a %A and the market is %%sopen!'),
        $clock->is_open ? '' : 'not ';

Returns a Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Clock object.

The clock endpoint serves the current market timestamp, whether or not the
market is currently open, as well as the times of the next market open and
close.

## `calendar( [...] )`

Returns a list of Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Calendar objects.

The calendar endpoint serves the full list of market days from 1970 to 2029.

The following parameters are accepted:

- `end` - The last date to retrieve data for (inclusive); Time::Moment object or RFC3339 string

Both listed parameters are optional. If neither is provided, the calendar will
begin on January 1st, 1970.

## `assets( [...] )`

Returns a list of Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Asset objects.
