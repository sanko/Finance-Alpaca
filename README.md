# NAME

Finance::Alpaca - It's new $module

# SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Alpaca;

# DESCRIPTION

Finance::Alpaca is ... still under construction.

# METHODS

## `new( ... )`

    my $camelid = Finance::Alpaca->new(
        keys => [ 'MDJOHHAE5BDE2FAYAEQT',
                  'Xq9p6ovxaa5XKihaEDRgpMapjeWYd5gIM63iq5BL'
                ] );

Creates a new Finance::Alpaca object.

This constructor accepts the following parameters:

- `keys` - `[ $APCA_API_KEY_ID, $APCA_API_SECRET_KEY ]`

    Every API call requires authentication. You must provide these keys which may
    be acquired in the developer web console and are only visible on creation.

- `paper` - Boolean value

    If you're attempting to use Alpaca's paper trading functionality, this **must**
    be a true value. Otherwise, you will be making live trades with actual assets.

    **Note**: This is a false value by default.

## `account( )`

including account status, funds available for trade, funds available for
withdrawal, and various flags relevant to an accountâ€™s ability to trade.

    my $clock = $camelid->clock();
    say sprintf
        $clock->timestamp->strftime('It is %l:%M:%S %p on a %A and the market is %%sopen!'),
        $clock->is_open ? '' : 'not ';

    );

If the order is placed successfully, this method returns a
Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Order object. Failures result in hash references with
data from the API.

An order request may be rejected if the account is not authorized for trading,
or if the tradable balance is insufficient to fill the order.

The following parameters are accepted:

- `symbol` - symbol or asset ID to identify the asset to trade (Required)
- `qty` - number of shares to trade. Can be fractionable for only `market` and `day` order types (Required)
- `notional` -dollar amount to trade. Cannot work with qty. Can only work for `market` order types and `day` for time in force (Required)

    - `limit_price` - Required for bracket orders
- `stop_loss` - Additional parameters for stop-loss leg of advanced orders
    - `stop_price` - Required for braket orders
    - `limit_price` - The stop-loss order becomes a stop-limit order if specified

## `replace_order( ..., ... )`

    my $new_order = $camelid->reaplace_order(
        $order->id,
        qty => 3,
        time_in_force => 'fok'
        limit_price => 120
    );

Replaces a single order with updated parameters. Each parameter overrides the
corresponding attribute of the existing order. The other attributes remain the
same as the existing order.

A success return code from a replaced order does NOT guarantee the existing
open order has been replaced. If the existing open order is filled before the
replacing (new) order reaches the execution venue, the replacing (new) order is
rejected, and these events are sent in the trade\_updates stream channel.

While an order is being replaced, buying power is reduced by the larger of the
two orders that have been placed (the old order being replaced, and the newly
placed order to replace it). If you are replacing a buy entry order with a
higher limit price than the original order, the buying power is calculated
based on the newly placed order. If you are replacing it with a lower limit
price, the buying power is calculated based on the old order.

In addition to the original order's ID, this method expects the following
parameters:

- `qty` - number of shares to trade
- `time_in_force` - `day`, `gtc`, `opg`, `cls`, `ioc`, `fok`. Please see [Understand Orders](https://alpaca.markets/docs/trading-on-alpaca/orders/#time-in-force) for more info
- `limit_price` - required if `type` is `limit` or `stop_limit`
- `stop_price` - required if `type` is `stop` or `stop_limit`
- `trail` - the new value of the `trail_price` or `trail_percent` value (works only where `type` is `trailing_stop`)
- `client_order_id` - A unique identifier (UUID v4) for the order. Automatically generated by Alpaca if not sent.

## `cancel_orders( )`

    $camelid->cancel_orders( );

Attempts to cancel all open orders.

On success, an array of hashes will be returned each with the following
elements:

- `body` - Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Order object
- `id` - the order ID (UUID)
- `status` - HTTP status code for the request

A response will be provided for each order that is attempted to be cancelled.
If an order is no longer cancelable, the server will reject the request and and
empty list will be returned.

## `cancel_order( ... )`

    $camelid->cancel_order( 'be07eebc-13f0-4072-aa4c-f67046081276' );

Attempts to cancel an open order. If the order is no longer cancelable
(example: `status` is `filled`), the server will respond with status 422,
reject the request, and an empty list will be returned. Upon acceptance of the
cancel request, it returns status 204 and a true value.

## `positions( )`

    $camelid->positions( );

Retrieves a list of the accountâ€™s open positions and returns a list of
Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Positon objects.

## `positon( ... )`

returns a Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Positoin object if found.

If not found, and empty list is returned.

## `close_all_positions( [...] )`

    my $panic = $camelid->close_all_positions( );

Closes (liquidates) all of the accountâ€™s open long and short positions.

    $panic = $camelid->close_all_positions( 1 );

This method accepts one optional parameter which, if true, will cancel all open
orders before liquidating all positions.

On success, an array of hashes will be returned each with the following
elements:

- `body` - Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Order object
- `id` - the order ID (UUID)
- `status` - HTTP status code for the request

A response will be provided for each position that is attempted to be closed.

## `close_position( ..., [...] )`

    my $order = $camelid->close_position('MSFT');
    $order    = $camelid->close_position( 'b6d1aa75-5c9c-4353-a305-9e2caa1925ab' );

Closes (liquidates) the accountâ€™s open position for the given symbol or asset
ID and returns a Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Order object. Works for both long and
short positions.

    my $order = $camelid->close_position('MSFT', 0.5);

This method accepts a second, optional parameter which is the number of shares
to liquidate.

## `portfolio_history( [...] )`

    $camelid->portfolio_history( );

- `date_end` - The date the data is returned up to, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format or as a Time::Moment object. Defaults to the current market date (rolls over at the market open if `extended_hours` is false, otherwise at 7am ET)
- `extended_hours` Boolean value; if true, include extended hours in the result. This is effective only for timeframe less than `1D`.

The returned data is in a hash ref with the following keys:

## `activities( [...] )`

    my @activities = $camelid->activities();

Returns account activity entries for many types of activities.

    @activities = $camelid->activities(activity_types => [qw[ACATC ACATS]]);

[Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Activity](https://metacpan.org/pod/Finance%3A%3AAlpaca%3A%3AStruct%3A%3AActivity) for a list of activity types.

This method expects a combination of the following optional parameters:

- `activity_types` - A list of the activity types to include in the response. If unspecified, activities of all types will be returned.
- `date` - The date for which you want to see activities as string or Time::Moment object
- `until` - The response will contain only activities submitted before this date. (Cannot be used with `date`.)
- `after` - The response will contain only activities submitted after this date. (Cannot be used with `date`.)
- `direction` - `asc` or `desc` (default is `desc` if unspecified.)
- `page_size` - The maximum number of entries to return in the response
- `page_token` - The ID of the end of your current page of results

### Paging of Results

Pagination is handled using the `page_token` and `page_size` parameters.
`page_token` represents the ID of the end of your current page of results. If
specified with a direction of `desc`, for example, the results will end before
the activity with the specified ID. If specified with a direction of `asc`,
results will begin with the activity immediately after the one specified.
`page_size` is the maximum number of entries to return in the response. If
`date` is not specified, the default and maximum value is `100`. If `date`
is specified, the default behavior is to return all results, and there is no
maximum page size.
