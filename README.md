# NAME

Finance::Alpaca - It's new $module

# SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Alpaca;

# DESCRIPTION

Finance::Alpaca is ... still under construction.

# METHODS

## `new( ... )`

    my $camelid = Finance::Alpaca->new(
        keys => [ 'MDJOHHAE5BDE2FAYAEQT',
                  'Xq9p6ovxaa5XKihaEDRgpMapjeWYd5gIM63iq5BL'
                ] );

Creates a new Finance::Alpaca object.

This constructor accepts the following parameters:

- `keys` - `[ $APCA_API_KEY_ID, $APCA_API_SECRET_KEY ]`

    Every API call requires authentication. You must provide these keys which may
    be acquired in the developer web console and are only visible on creation.

- `paper` - Boolean value

    If you're attempting to use Alpaca's paper trading functionality, this **must**
    be a true value. Otherwise, you will be making live trades with actual assets.

    **Note**: This is a false value by default.

## `account( )`

The account endpoint serves important information related to an account,
including account status, funds available for trade, funds available for
withdrawal, and various flags relevant to an accountâ€™s ability to trade.

    my $clock = $camelid->clock();
    say sprintf
        $clock->timestamp->strftime('It is %l:%M:%S %p on a %A and the market is %%sopen!'),
        $clock->is_open ? '' : 'not ';

Returns a Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Clock object.

The clock endpoint serves the current market timestamp, whether or not the
market is currently open, as well as the times of the next market open and

If the order is placed successfully, this method returns a
Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Order object. Failures result in hash references with
data from the API.

An order request may be rejected if the account is not authorized for trading,
or if the tradable balance is insufficient to fill the order.

The following parameters are accepted:

- `symbol` - symbol or asset ID to identify the asset to trade (Required)
- `qty` - number of shares to trade. Can be fractionable for only `market` and `day` order types (Required)

- `type` - `market`, `limit`, `stop`, `stop_limit`, or `trailing_stop` (Required)
- `time_in_force` - `day`, `gtc`, `opg`, `cls`, `ioc`, `fok`. Please see [Understand Orders](https://alpaca.markets/docs/trading-on-alpaca/orders/#time-in-force) for more info (Required)
- `limit_price` - Required if `type` is `limit` or `stop_limit`
- `stop_price` - Required if `type` is `stop` or `stop_limit`
- `trail_price` - This or `trail_percent` is required if `type` is `trailing_stop`
- `trail_percent` - This or `trail_price` is required if `type` is `trailing_stop`
- `extended_hours` - If a `true` value, order will be eligible to execute in premarket/afterhours. Only works with `type` is `limit` and `time_in_force` is `day`
- `client_order_id` - A unique identifier (UUID v4) for the order. Automatically generated by Alpaca if not sent.
- `order_class` - `simple`, `bracket`, `oco` or `oto`. For details of non-simple order classes, please see [Bracket Order Overview](https://alpaca.markets/docs/trading-on-alpaca/orders#bracket-orders)
- `take_profit` - Additional parameters for `take_profit` leg of advanced orders
    - `limit_price` - Required for bracket orders
- `stop_loss` - Additional parameters for stop-loss leg of advanced orders
    - `stop_price` - Required for braket orders
    - `limit_price` - The stop-loss order becomes a stop-limit order if specified

## `replace_order( ..., ... )`

    my $new_order = $camelid->reaplace_order(
        $order->id,
        qty => 3,
        time_in_force => 'fok'
        limit_price => 120
    );

Replaces a single order with updated parameters. Each parameter overrides the
corresponding attribute of the existing order. The other attributes remain the
same as the existing order.

A success return code from a replaced order does NOT guarantee the existing
open order has been replaced. If the existing open order is filled before the
replacing (new) order reaches the execution venue, the replacing (new) order is
rejected, and these events are sent in the trade\_updates stream channel.

While an order is being replaced, buying power is reduced by the larger of the
two orders that have been placed (the old order being replaced, and the newly
placed order to replace it). If you are replacing a buy entry order with a
higher limit price than the original order, the buying power is calculated
based on the newly placed order. If you are replacing it with a lower limit
price, the buying power is calculated based on the old order.

In addition to the original order's ID, this method expects the following
parameters:

- `qty` - number of shares to trade
- `time_in_force` - `day`, `gtc`, `opg`, `cls`, `ioc`, `fok`. Please see [Understand Orders](https://alpaca.markets/docs/trading-on-alpaca/orders/#time-in-force) for more info
- `limit_price` - required if `type` is `limit` or `stop_limit`
- `stop_price` - required if `type` is `stop` or `stop_limit`
- `trail` - the new value of the `trail_price` or `trail_percent` value (works only where `type` is `trailing_stop`)
- `client_order_id` - A unique identifier (UUID v4) for the order. Automatically generated by Alpaca if not sent.
