=head1 NAME

Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Watchlist - A Single Watchlist Object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Alpaca;
    my @watchlists = Finance::Alpaca->new( ... )->watchlists;
    say $watchlists[0]->

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The assets API provides CRUD operation for the accountâ€™s watchlist. An
account can have multiple watchlists and each is uniquely identified by C<id>
but can also be addressed by user-defined C<name>. Each watchlist is an ordered
list of L<assets|Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Asset>.

=head1 Properties

The following properties are contained in the object.

    for my $asset ($watchlist->assets()) {
        say $asset->symbol;
    }

=over

=item C<id> - Watchlist ID (UUID)

=item C<created_at> - Timestamp as a Time::Moment object

=item C<updated_at> - Timestamp as a Time::Moment object

=item C<name> - User-defined watchlist name (up to C<64> characters)

=item C<account_id> - Account ID (UUID)

=item C<assets> - The content of this watchlist in the order as registered by the client
