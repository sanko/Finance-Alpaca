=head1 NAME

Finance::Alpaca::Struct::Account - A Single Account Object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Alpaca;
    my $acct = Finance::Alpaca->new( ... )->account;
    say sprintf 'I can%s short!', $acct->shorting_enabled ? '' : 'not';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The account API serves important information related to an account, including
account status, funds available for trade, funds available for withdrawal, and
various flags relevant to an account’s ability to trade. An account maybe be
blocked for just for trades (trades_blocked flag) or for both trades and
transfers (account_blocked flag) if Alpaca identifies the account to engaging
in any suspicious activity. Also, in accordance with FINRA’s pattern day
trading rule, an account may be flagged for pattern day trading
(pattern_day_trader  flag), which would inhibit an account from placing any
further day-trades.

=head1 Properties
